# Tutorial 4
============
I, fegin, will read the document and make sure I understand the logistics and instructions. In the future, I'll try to fix these issues with the instructions specified below. If I have any further question I'll ask on Piazza.

## Logstics
--------
1. For all future labs and recitations, the scores will be post to NYU classes. CSO graders will post on Piazza when the scores are ready. 
   * If I have any question about the score, I must contact CSO graders before the deadline specified in the post.
2. All the deadlines are 11:59 PM on the due date. Any late submission will not be considered.
   * For example, if I submit at 0:06 AM for recitation, I realized that submit will be ignored.
3. All the future recitation deadline will be on Tuesday nights instead of Monday.
4. I must follow all the instructions CSO graders and instructors post on Piazza. Especially the ones pinned by the graders.
   * For example, CSO graders have posted how to use grace days for labs. In the future, any submission with incorrect format will be ignored. 
5. When doing labs, I have to always follow the instructions. I won't change the output format. If I don't understand the output format, I'll ask on Piazza.
6. Plagiarism examples:
   * For game of life, I can look up how to read a file in C language on the Internet. But the logic of game of life must be entirely implemented by myself.


## GIT instructions

==========
The due date for this exercise is 3/9. In this exercise, we provide you a file called, **CSO\_CHEAT\_SHEET.md**. This file contains the logistics for the class and git instructions. To finish this exercise, you have to read through the document and replace any **fegin** in the document with **YOUR GITHUB USER NAME**. After finishing this exercise, the document should contains ZERO **fegin**, even the **fegin** in a URL must be replaced. If the document contains even just one **fegin**, you will get ZERO score for this exercise. Your overall recitation credits may also be deducted due to not paying attention to this exercise. All other characters in the document should not be modified.
